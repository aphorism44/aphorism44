# aphorism44 

This is my current programming-hobbyist website (http://www.aphorism44.com/), along with my blog and some links.

This is _always_ a work in progress. I used an extremely simple WAMP - Apache/PHP/MySQL. I'd like to switch to Python/Django, but an "economy" page at goDaddy doesn't support that.

I wrote the blog from scratch and it needs improvement. The comments have no protection against spam. The CSS properties need to be tweaked to handle the blog images better. I need to add tinyMCE to my editing page.  However, I'm more concerned with programming than blogging, so that remains low priority.

The "life fractal" project is by far the most complex item here. I'm taking a stab at creating a "literary hypertext" web app.  These pages are roped off right now, but it incorporates some sophisticated jQuery to make the forms work more smoothly. It's something I've been soliticiting feedback on and continually improving.

The page was originally written with Aptana Studio 3, but I plan on importing it into a NetBeans project since Aptana has lousy git support (it's easier to just use the command line than Aptana's tools).
