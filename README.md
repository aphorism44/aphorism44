Until September 2016, this was my personal website. As I had originally created it several years earlier, it was still running on a LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) stack. It has since been upgraded to a more modern MEAN stack, which is also available in my repo.

I wrote the blog from scratch, using tinyMCE to edit.  However, this approach was extremely limiting, so in my MEAN stack, I went ahead and just linked to WordPress.

The "life fractal" project was by far the most complex item here. I was taking a stab at creating a "literary hypertext" web app.  However, the design was limited by the technology (tinyMCE again, along with jQuery), and it may be awhile if I return to the ideas, if ever.

The page was entirely written with Aptana Studio 3, and all from scratch.
